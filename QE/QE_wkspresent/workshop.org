| *rm -f file*      | force remove file                                                  |
| *rm -rf dir*      | force remove directory dir *                                       |
| *cp file1 file2*  | copy file1 to file2                                                |
| *cp -r dir1 dir2* | copy dir1 to dir2; create dir2 if it                               |
|                   | doesn't exist                                                      |
| *mv file1 file2*  | rename or move file1 to file2                                      |
|                   | if file2 is an existing directory moves file1 into directory file2 |

| *tail -f file*    | output the contents of file as it                                  |


** Bash scripting (/for/ and /while/  loops) 

* Fisrt steps to PW

** Excercise 1. (INPUT file)

- getting exp or computed structure from online databases
- generating input files using easy tools
- visulizing  them using _xcrysden_, _VESTA_, _gdis_, or _ase-gui_ ...

** SCF and convergency test for GaAs
{{{color(blue,In this exercise we will first perform simple scf (self-consistent field) calculations on GaAs structure)}}}

+ STEP 1. Use Xcrysden to view the structure of input file and explore different utilities
+ STEP 2. Open and read the input file
Note that in the &control namelist, we have specified that we want to run an *scf* calculation.\\
GaAs has the diamond structure. Note that we are using a (primitive) unit cell that corresponds to an fcc lattice, with 2 atoms in the atomic basis.\\
Notice the values given for ibrav, nat, ntyp and ATOMIC-POSITIONS.\\
In this file, the lattice constant {{{color(red,celldm(1))}}} has been set equal to 10.86626 bohr, which is the experimental value. \\
A 2×2×2 Monkhorst-Pack {{{color(red,k-point mesh.)}}}  has been used. \\
The plane-wave cut-off for wavefunctions, ecutwfc, has been set to 30 Ry. Since we are not using an ultrasoft pseudopotential. \\

+ STEP 3. Run your input using following command

~cd ~/WORKSHOP_QE/BULK/SECTION-SCF~  \\
~pw.x < GaAs.scf.in | tee GaAs.scf.out~

* Cell and atomic position relaxation

* Post-Processing (Charge, Electrostatic Potential)

* Post-Processing ( Dos and Projected Dos)

* 2D-Systems ( Making Slabs )
